                        As a detail-oriented and innovative Engineering professional with several years experience I realize the 
                        importance of identifying client and company demands, goals and obstacles in order to effectively execute 
                        innovative solutions for productivity problems. Recently, I have expanded roles which provide detailed 
                        experience in software development and application management, and have been recognized for utilizing my 
                        technical aptitude to research, analyze and ‘self-teach’ emerging advanced software development skills. 
                        Throughout my career, I have continuously added value to the organization I represent and have a proven 
                        record of success.
